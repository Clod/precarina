  "txtAbout": "This app has been developed based on the scientific and medical knowledge of a team of pediatricians from Dr. Ricardo Gutiérrez Children's Hospital in Buenos Aires, including:<br/><strong>Ángela Sardella</strong> - Médica Pediatra y Cardióloga Pediatra. <br/><strong>Marina Vaccari</strong> - Médica Pediatra y Cardióloga Infantil certificada en hipertensión arterial. <br/><strong>Maria Sol Elorriaga</strong> - Médica Pediatra, Cardióloga infantil y Deportóloga. <br/><strong>Barbara Wagmaister</strong> - Médica Pediatra y Cardióloga Pediatra.<br/><strong>Miriam Tonietti</strong> - Médica Pediatra especialista en Nutrición y Diabetes.</strong> <br/><strong>Patricia Palenque</strong> - Licenciada en Nutrición y Docente adscripta de la U.B.A.<span style=\"color:red\"><p>We suggest that this app be primarily considered as a tool for HEALTH PROFESSIONALS to assess and promote a healthy lifestyle in pediatric clinical practice, especially for younger ages. Formal scoring is optional and physicians should emphasize lifelong concepts and well-being rather than specific scores, given the scarcity of data to support a scoring framework.<br></br>Cardiovascular health should be assessed from childhood. Numerous studies have shown that there are abnormalities in pediatric ages and it is associated with subclinical CVD in middle age.</p></span><br></br> <p>The short and medium-term health outcomes (including tracking metrics in adolescence and adulthood) are strong enough for diet, physical activity (screen time and play), sleep, exposure to secondhand smoke, and body weight\n to be addressed and advised during routine visits for healthy children.</p>"
